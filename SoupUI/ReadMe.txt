* This test project is created using SoapUI 5.4.0.
* Load project from Auden-CurrencyConversion-soapui-project.xml file included
* Project consists of one Test Suite (GetCurrencyConversionRates)
* Test Suite Contains of 2 test cases 
         1 - USD_GBP TestCase
         2 - GBP_USD TestCase
* Both Tests can be executed by sending request to specied endpoint url.
  NOTE: When attempted to run the tests using test runner, all over a sudden, any requests sent returned 0. Not sure why, thus advisable not to try to run from test runner.
        Up until this exercise, I'd never used Soap UI before, rather more familiar with Postman, so I'm not certain at all why suddenly responses was returning "0" after trying to execute tests in a runner.
